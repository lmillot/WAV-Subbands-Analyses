# WAV-Subbands-Analyses
This project consists of two types of tools.
1. Tools programmed in Python, in the form of scripts or Jupyter notebooks and scripts for the main tools. These tools are used to implement IDS analysis (Integrated Spectral Density Analysis) of WAV files, using frequency mapping into subbands, and to prepare the data required for real-time resynthesis and partial to total resynthesis of the signals studied.
2. IDS resynthesizers programmed with Max which, for a given frequency mapping, allow you to listen to a partial to total re-synthesis of the signals analyzed. 
Information on IDS analysis can be found on my ReasearchGate page (researchgate.net/profile/Laurent_Millot).

### Videos explaining how to install, configure and use all these tools will be posted on my Autopscience YouTube channel(www.youtube.com/@autopscience5311) as soon as possible.
